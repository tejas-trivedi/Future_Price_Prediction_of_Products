# Future_Price_Prediction_of_Products
I have made a future price prediction model using Facebook Prophet. Here I've used the avocado price dataset of USA.


Facebook Prophet is an open source tool used for time series forecasting. <br/>
Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects.<br/>
Prophet works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. 


In this project I've predicted the future price of Avacados in entire USA as well as region wise.<br/>
For this I've used the avacado dataset which had data collected from 2015 to 2018. Following is the result of the model.




## Future prediction of price in entire USA.

Here the black dots represent the price associated at particular time and the region containing these dots is our history of prices.
The graph further tells the predicted price of the product. As we can see the future price in entire country will decrease in the next year. This prediction is very helpful as it tells the future demand for the product and helps in pre availability.
